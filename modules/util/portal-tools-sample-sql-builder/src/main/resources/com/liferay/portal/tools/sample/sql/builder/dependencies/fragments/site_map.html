				<p>The amount a buyer can borrow is usually based on a percentage of the property value. If a buyer makes an offer that is too high and the property is down-valued by their lender''s surveyor, the lender may refuse to offer the buyer the required finance and the sale could collapse.</p>
				<p>Previous property sale prices are also available online with a quick search. However, Peter shares a word of caution on property valuation sites: "You don’t necessarily know that you’re comparing like for like with this information. It can also be fairly out of date by the time it goes live as sales take many months to process. In a changing market, those few months can make a huge difference."
